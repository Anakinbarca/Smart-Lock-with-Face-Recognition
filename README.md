# Smart-Lock-with-Face-Recognition
The initial idea of this project is to develop a smart lock, which can be opened by recognizing the faces, of the people that live in the house through a camera. The face recognition is made by a system, trained with the LBP algorithm. Its function is extended, for the security of the house, by calling the police in case that an unknown face is keep trying to open the door, or need a double check through mobile notification, in a bad scenario, that someone of the inhabitants had come threatened with an unknown person. The system also contains control and push notifications over the owners Smartphone, as well as various combinations with motion sensors inside the house. The smart lock, in this project, is implemented with a servo linear actuator.
